This folder contains about face recognition algorithm which is implemented in pycharm.

Implementation-
It contains python code for face recognition. 
There are two written codes -
1] Recognition_part1.py which on execution captures images of user and no. of images to be captured is specified by user in code. We have specified 300 images.
2] Recognition_part2.py which on execution checks on realtime whether the user is present or not in front of camera whose image has beem captured on Recognition_part1.py
   If the user is recognised then it shows the recognition percentage ,and also shows "UNLOCKED" written .

Requirements-
1]Installed venv environment in  project.
2]Installed numpy package in project.
3]Installed opencv-python package in project.
4]Installed opencv-contrib-python package in project.
5]Also installed haarscascade_frontal_face_default.xml in project.

And output is shown in Recognition_part2_Output.jpg which is present in folder.
