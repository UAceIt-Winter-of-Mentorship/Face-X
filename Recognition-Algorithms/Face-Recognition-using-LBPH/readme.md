# Overview

## *LBPH -> Local Binary Patterns Histogram*

It is based on local binary operator. It is widely used in facial recognition due to its computational simplicity and discriminative power. 

**It is very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.**
The steps involved to achieve this are:

* creating dataset
* face acquisition
* feature extraction
* classification

The LBPH algorithm is a part of opencv.
